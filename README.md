## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org/download](http://nodejs.org/download)

### Install `javascripting` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install --global javascripting
```

The `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

#### Having issues with installation?

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:

```
sudo npm install --global javascripting
```

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Take a look at this npm documentation:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions
